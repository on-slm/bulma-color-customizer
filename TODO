# TODOs
## MUST HAVE
- [ ] TODO Rewrite all the messy code - make it resembling code written according to the BP
- [ ] TODO Restructure all files in the Views directory - reduce number of files, make them simpler, etc (rule of thumb: max only 2-3 pug files needed for presenting one page of the web)
- [ ] TODO Delete all unnecessary files and folders
- [ ] TODO Remove all unnecessary comments
- [ ] TODO Make use of ES6 syntax everywhere

## IDEAS AND PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE CONSIDERATION
* Rewrite app's views by utilizing any of popular frontend framework: Angular2 / React / Vuejs / (maybe even Elm)
